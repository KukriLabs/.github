# Kukri Labs

Focused, pay-what-you-want SaaS projects to help startups & indie builders save time and increase revenue.

## What does that mean?

- Focused = our products are lean, don't suffer from feature bloat and easy to use;
- Pay-what-you-want = no minimum price, our projects are designed to help you and you pay what you can afford;
- SaaS projects = we build it and run it, you use it;
- Help startups & indie builders = our products are purposefully simple, we're probably not much use in enterprise;
- Save time = no need to do it yourself, let us do it for you leaving you time to focus on your core business;
- Increase revenue = build trust, drive sales and expand your customer base to grow your business;

## I have an idea for a project

Great! Head over to our Github discussions and submit it there. We'll look at the viability (votes help us prioritize) and hopefully start building it.

## I need feature X

Most of our projects are purposefully tightly scoped and aim to fight against feature bloat. This means we can build simple, high performance, low cost software that solves a problem. We're open to discuss it but please don't get your hopes up. Ask yourself if you _really_ need your feature and, if you _really_ do, maybe this isn't the best solution for you.
